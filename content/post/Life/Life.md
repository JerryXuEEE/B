<h2 id="Music">Music-Guitar</h2> 
<p>
When I was about 9, I was playing with toy when I suddenly pictured myself playing the electrical guitar on the stage with a wild posture. Since then, I've been learning guitar until now, a 13 year guitar journey. At the beginning, I learnt the classical guitar for 3 years and then steel folk guitar until middle school. Due to stressful schoolwork, I quitted for a year. Then in the senior high school, I picked it up under the influence of my dear friend, Haoyang Chen, who taught me about the Fingerstyle Guitar. Then my genuine passion towards guitar eventually went off. I began to learn about Tommy Emmaneul, Kotaro Oshio. These classical guitar master showed me the emotion conveying through every single note under a touch on the string. In college, I learnt about Jazz Music, again under the influence of Chen. I learnt about the beauty during the conflicting and compromising in music, and the freedom and novelty in recomposing and improvising in Jazz. Therefore, I began to read books about Music Theory and Composing instead of Physics in the library. I'm especially fond of two young and talented guitar musicians, Satoshi Gogo and Seiji Igusa. Their albulms especially those published in the last decade were my favorite. Although I am fan of guitar, I'm a rebel in my heart, deeply impressed by the piano, the king of the instrument. Denstiny has given me an opportunity to take a walk with a girl from Sichuan Conservatory of Music, who is now my beloved girlfriend. A "custodian" on my road towards the palace of the music. I now picture myself as an old man, playing the guitar, playing the Jazz with some odd chords on a sofa beside a bonfire.

Under the influence of my dad, I always find a sense of relief in exercise. Thirty minute running along the river near my neighborhood was my nostalgia towards my childhood. Since year three of juniour high, I began to play basketball as I found it fun to make cool and cazy move. Although I might not be good at it, I still found complacence when I made those exaggerated head fake. In senior high, I wanted to impress my fellow classmates with advanced basketball skills. I remember in that whole summer, when every night was my specialized training  including 10 minutes dribbling, 20 minutes spot shooting and 20 minutes jump shot. Til now I'm still amazed at this motivated boy with enthusiam and persistance that I now particularly desire. In college, I joined in the basketball team  and found myself a place in basketball field. However, later I left as I thought I was not treated with respect. Till now, basketball is still an entertaining activity for me as it involves team work, where I have a great time with my friend. As I grow up, I've gradually gained relistic idear towards basketball, that this is just a way to relax, which is merely an aid to the main course.
