<h3 id="Ach1">The Neural Asymmetry Deviations Between Guitarists and Pianists <em> OHBM (Organization of Human Brain Mapping)</em></h3>
<p>
This abstract was accepted in 2021.12.15. The conference took place in Glasgow in 2022.7, which I was not able to attend due to the pandamic. I uploaded a 5 minustes video recording the <strong>oral report</strong> about my research.</p>
<p>
This research is about the neural asymmetry of pianists and guitarists. We recruited 10 guitarists, 10 pianists and 10 nonmusicians and collected their EEG signals when performing a Hand Coordination Paradigm, a Bimual Pressing Task paradigm and a N-back Paradigm. 
</p>
<p>
In behavioral analysis, pianists demonstrate significantly shorter response time in bimanual task. In bimanual taskï¼Œfrontal and parietal areas in guitarists and pianists have higher intensity. More prominent asymmetric connectivity in FPN could be observed in guitarists</p>

This article was submitted in 2022.8.

<p>
This research is about the executive control comparing pianists and string musicians.

<p>
This abstract was accepted by the conference at <em>2022.8</em>. I will be presenting this report at the Henan Normal University in 2022,11,25. Afterwards, the abstract will be published on the cnki.net.

This article is about the executive control in musicians compared with non-musicians.
