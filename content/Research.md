<p>
This abstract was accepted in 2021.12.15. The conference took place in Glasgow in 2022.7, which I was not able to attend due to the pandamic. I uploaded a 5 minustes video recording the oral report about my research.</p>
<p>
This research is the "predecessor" of my journal article. It is about the neural asymmetry of pianists and guitarists. We recruited 10 guitarists, 10 pianists and 10 nonmusicians and collected their EEG signals when performing a Hand Coordination Paradigm, a Bimual Pressing Task paradigm and a N-back Paradigm. 
</p>
<p>
As I'm mainly intersted in the asymmetry, besides power spectrum, I did the Source Localization and functionaly connectivity and found that significant discrepancy could be obeserved in the frontal-parietal region.

<h3 id="Ach2">Different Music Training Modulates Theta Oscillation Associated with Executive Control</h3>
<p>
This article was submitted in 2022.8. 
</p>  
<p>
This research is about the executive control comparing pianists and string musicians.
</p>
<h3 id="Ach3"><em>National Academic Conference of Psychology</em></h3>
<p>
This abstract was accepted by the conference at 2022.7. I will be presenting this report at the Henan Normal University in 2022,11,25. Afterwards, the abstract will be published on the cnki.net.
</p>
<p>
This article is about the executive control in musicians compared with non-musicians.

Three years of research experience in the <em>Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education</em>   
have equipped me with rigorous experimental thinking, research reviewing skills, and a cooperative interdisciplinary mind.
I'm also a quick learner. I spent one month on the EEG data processing tools with the help of my senior, Dr. Long.
In everyday life, I enjoy quietly doing my stuff from day to night. I always find peace and fulfillment in such a quiet time.
I'm fully aware of the process and hardship of scientific research, more specifically, of publishing a journal article. 
Still, I constantly find myself immersed in the process of learning new things, amazing at novel discovery, and 
the sense of achievement in making progress in scientific research. 
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in neuroscience not only because I like the mysterious part of the brain, but also due to my dream of astonishing discovery that blazes a brand-new world. In my following research, I'm interested in computational neuroscience as I'm a science student. Neuroscience is an inter discipline field. I want to take advantage of my research background in cognitive neuroscience and EE major and devote myself to applying computer technology to discover more interesting facts about the brain.

Special thanks to my tutor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OLWmCDYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra"> Lu</a>, who has given me precious opportunities to learn and work in this lovely Lab. I want to show my forever gratitude for his cultivation and respect for his dedication from the bottom of my heart.
