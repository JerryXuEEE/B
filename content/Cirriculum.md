<h3>Brief Introduction of Related Courses</h3>
<p>Above grades shown are all related to scientific research field
    <dl>
        <dt>Engineering English</dt>
        <dd>This course is aimed at presenting essential accedmic English skills, including presentation, reading, and writing.
            During this course, I was the TA and favoured by both the foreing teachers and UESTC teachers.
            In this course, we had a lot of report to write to simulate acedmic paper writing, and a lot of presentations to give to simulate conference report.

        </dd>
        <dt>Team Design Project Skills(TDPS)</dt>
        <dd>This is a challenged and fun course which will be specifically introduced in <span href="/Cirriculum/#TDPS/">the following article</span>. 
            Generally, we (a team of 10 Students) were required to design a <strong>robotic rover</strong> to complete a series of tasks, including line tracking, shape recognization, and placing a tennis ball. 
            In this process, I'm mainly responsible for the shape recognition module and machine vision, developed by Micro Python for OpenMV. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Overall Introduction of Elective Cirriculum </dt>    
        During year two and three, I have attended the a series of courses about neuroscience (8 in total). 
        These courses consist  anatomical and cognitive theories, EEG MRI and data analysis. I'm currently studying computational neuroscience.
        In these courses, we also have to complete a series of experiment in the labotory such as EEG Gonogo, MRI static data acquisation, and invasive electrode on mice.
        The teachers come from different fields, including EEGï¼ŒMRI, cell, and have diverse backgrounds like cs, physics or psychology.
        Generally, these course combine scientific reseach and bsic theory to construct a basic understanding of neuroscience.
