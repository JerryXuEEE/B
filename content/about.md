 I'm majoring in EE and I have a profound interest in Neuroscience, and I've been working in the team of [Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ClUoWqsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and with my tutor [Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OLWmCDYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) <em> Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education <em> since the end of year one in college. I have published a journal article at Brain Sciences and two pieces of conferecne paper at OHBM(Organization of Human Brain Mapping) and the National Academic Conference of Psychology all as the first author.In November 17,I'm about to present a report at the National Academic Conference of Psychology at the Henan Normal University.   
 I have a great interest in scientific research targeted at the brain technology, believing that this is the future of the human race. I believe this is an arcane and grandeur field to devote to.
