My name is Jerry Xu (Ruijie Xu). 
I'm a <strong>year four undergraduate student</strong> from <em>UESTC</em> (University of Electric Science and Technology of China). 
I'm applying for <strong>PhD position</strong> in Bioengineering aimed at computational neuroscience and BMI.
I'm majoring in <strong>EE</strong> and I have a profound interest in Neuroscience, 
and I've been working in the team of [Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ClUoWqsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 
and with my tutor [Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OLWmCDYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) 
in <em> Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education </em> since the end of year one in college. 
I have published a <strong> journal article</strong> at the <em>Brain Sciences</em> and two pieces of conferecne paper at the <em>OHBM</em>(Organization of Human Brain Mapping) 
and the National Academic Conference of Psychology all as the first author.
In November 17,I'm about to present a report at the National Academic Conference of Psychology at the Henan Normal University.   
I have a great interest in scientific research targeted at the brain technology, believing that this is the future of the human race. 
I think this is an arcane and grandeur field to devote to.
